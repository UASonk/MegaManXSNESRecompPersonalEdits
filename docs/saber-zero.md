# Saber Zero reference

Saber Zero was written by [RaphaelAzev](https://github.com/RaphaelAzev) in the
[MegaManXSNESRecompSaberZero](https://github.com/RaphaelAzev/MegaManXSNESRecompSaberZero)
fork and merged here. It is a **Zero behavior**, alongside X3 and Modern: it
keeps the X3 Zero character and adds a Saber attack owner, the X3
finisher/wave sequence, priority-aware follow-ups, donor sprites and sound
effects, Ride Armor pilot art, and an optional hitbox overlay.

Choose **Zero behavior → Saber Zero** in **Characters → Add Zero** (single
player; **Starting character** and the native Select exchange are unchanged) or
in **Characters → Co-op** (Saber belongs to whichever seat is Zero). Both
features already ask for the player's **Mega Man X3 USA** ROM; Saber Zero uses
that same selection. ROMs are never included.

X has ground dash from the start while the Zero feature is active. Air dash for
both X and Zero unlocks when the Chill Penguin boots capsule is collected.

The package's sprite and sound-effect donors are credited in
[assets/saber-zero/CREDITS.md](../assets/saber-zero/CREDITS.md). They are by
the Zashiko Mod, are included for non-commercial use, and must not be used
commercially. This project is not monetized.

## Controls

The physical SNES pad rules are deliberately narrow: Saber owns Y; X is ignored
with the buster selected and continues to fire an equipped special weapon. The
other native controls remain available.

| Button | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Y | Start/continue a Saber attack. On the ground it starts the 3-hit combo; in the air it is an air slash; on a wall it is a wall slash; during a grounded dash it is a dash slash. A held Y produces one edge. |
| X | Ignored when the buster is selected (Saber Zero cannot charge or fire it); otherwise fires the selected special weapon. X cannot start a special shot while a Saber slash, finisher, or wave-shooting animation owns the action. |
| B | Native jump. |
| A | Native dash. |
| Direction | Native movement. Ground swings and dash swings mask the movement edges required by their attack state, so holding the opposite direction cannot turn a swing. |
| Select | Native X/Zero exchange in the normal standing exchange context. |

Hurt, death, reset, menus, and an exchange to X cancel the Saber owner for that
frame. With the buster selected, X never starts a charge, creates a buster shot,
or releases a stale charge latch. Equipped special weapons retain their X input
outside attacks that own the action.

## Saber attacks

The ground combo is driven by distinct Y press edges:

1. Ground slash 1 has 2 startup frames, 6 active frames, and 10 recovery
   frames. Its chain window is ticks 7 through 17, with an early buffer from
   ticks 2 through 6.
2. Ground slash 2 has 0 startup, 8 active frames, and 8 recovery frames. Its
   chain window is ticks 6 through 15, with an early buffer from ticks 0
   through 5.
3. Ground slash 3 has 0 startup, 10 active frames, and 12 recovery frames. It
   has no fourth combo entry.

An air slash is 2 startup, 6 active, and 4 recovery frames. A wall slash is 0
startup, 8 active, and 6 recovery frames. A dash slash is 1 startup, 8 active,
and 9 recovery frames. Each of those is a single attack. These faster timings
are an X4-inspired adaptation, not a frame-exact port of X4's combat engine. The attack
owner uses the native action context for jump, dash, wall cling, landing, hurt,
and death transitions, so an attack does not create a second movement system.

The default normal damage is 3 / 3 / 8 for the ground combo, 3 for air, wall,
and dash, 16 for the X3 finisher, and 6 for each wave pulse. The boss values
are intentionally lower; the full defaults are in the option table below.
Damage is applied once per enemy per swing where the current attack owner
requires that protection.

## Saber finisher and wave

After the third ground slash naturally completes, a finisher window opens. It is
27 frames by default and can be tuned from 12 to 60. Press Y again during that
window to request the existing X3 finisher. The request reserves a projectile
slot for the wave, starts the finisher animation, and publishes the wave at
finisher age 7. If no slot can be reserved, the Y edge is consumed but the
finisher/wave reservation cannot be completed. The buster is not used to enter
this move; while the finisher or wave-shooting animation is active, X cannot
start a special shot.

## Hit priority

Saber Zero records the priority and frame of an eligible hit on an enemy. A
later eligible follow-up can use the native positive collision path to break
ordinary enemy invincibility only when its priority is strictly higher and the
follow-up arrives inside the priority window. The default window is 70 frames.
Equal-priority and lower-priority hits do not qualify. Native forced states,
bit-7/reflection responses, and the protected Armadillo cases are not broadly
overridden; the priority response only changes the specific admitted follow-up
path.

The default ladder is:

| Priority | Classes |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | Air slash, wall slash, small charge, full charge |
| 2 | Ground slash 1, max shot 1 |
| 3 | Ground slash 2, max shot 2 |
| 4 | Ground slash 3, X3 finisher |
| 5 | Dash slash, Saber wave |

The ladder is configurable through the priority options. This is a follow-up
system, not a general “ignore all invincibility” switch.

## Rendering and Ride Armor

The Saber player overlay supplies the body, blade, palette, layer, and facing to
the custom renderer. When Zero is piloting the Ride Armor, the pilot overlay is
selected from the Ride Armor animation and aligned to the native cockpit's
visible bounds and horizontal flip. The alignment is measured against the
native OAM result rather than a fixed screen offset.

`show_hitboxes` is false by default. When enabled, the custom renderer receives
debug rectangles for the enemy, Zero, and Saber attack boxes. It is a renderer
debug option; it does not change collision or damage.

## Saber Zero settings

Tuning lives in the separate **Characters → Saber Zero settings** feature
(`megaman-x.character.saber-zero`), which claims no plugin and does nothing
unless a Zero behavior is Saber Zero. While it is disabled every option keeps
the default below, even if a different value was stored earlier: a disabled
feature is left out of the netplay mod comparison, so its values must not reach
the game either. It exposes 31 numeric tuning options and `show_hitboxes`. Normal damage values accept 1–32; boss damage accepts 0–32,
where 0 means “use the matching normal value”; priority values accept 1–9.
The window ranges are 30–120 frames for priority and 12–60 frames for the
finisher. Swing volume ranges from 0–200 in steps of 10.

| Group | Options and defaults |
|-------|----------------------|
| Debug | `show_hitboxes=false` |
| Normal damage | `slash1_damage=3`, `slash2_damage=3`, `slash3_damage=8`, `x3_finisher_damage=16`, `air_damage=3`, `wall_damage=3`, `dash_damage=3`, `wave_damage=6` |
| Boss damage | `boss_slash1_damage=1`, `boss_slash2_damage=1`, `boss_slash3_damage=2`, `boss_air_damage=1`, `boss_wall_damage=1`, `boss_dash_damage=1`, `boss_x3_finisher_damage=6`, `boss_wave_damage=4` |
| Priority | `slash1_priority=2`, `slash2_priority=3`, `slash3_priority=4`, `air_priority=1`, `wall_priority=1`, `dash_priority=5`, `charge_small_priority=1`, `charge_full_priority=1`, `max_shot1_priority=2`, `max_shot2_priority=3`, `x3_finisher_priority=4`, `wave_priority=5` |
| Windows/audio | `priority_window_frames=70`, `finisher_window_frames=27`, `saber_swing_volume=50` |

## Co-op, savestates and netplay

Co-op runs the player routine once per seat. Saber's per-frame and per-hit
callbacks run only on Zero's seat; X's pass and co-op "ghost" replays leave
Saber state untouched, and a co-op seat exchange keeps it (it uses
`MmxZeroSelectState`, which does not reset the Zero extension). In co-op the
Saber pad is the seat's own X and Y, not port 1. A partner-seat Zero is drawn
with the Saber overlay as well; the Ride Armor pilot sheet is applied only to
the live seat, so a partner Zero piloting a Ride Armor keeps the native cockpit
art.

Saber's host-side state (attack, combo, hit priority, wave bookkeeping and the
pad edges) is part of the savestate as a fixed Zero-extension blob with its own Saber substate version,
so rewind, save states and netplay rollback restore a swing in progress instead
of cancelling it. Older saves load with Saber reset.

## Known limitations

With **Show hitboxes** in co-op, the Zero box follows the live seat, which may
be X. The **Developer → Hitbox overlay** mod outlines both seats and takes over
from this option when both are on. Saber Zero, Add Zero and Co-op remain the only features that use the
`megaman-x.zero` plugin key; Saber Zero settings uses none.

The fuzz test has not been run. The only boss-death issue found in the current
survey was Chill Penguin's native post-hit protection, and it is fixed. Other
bosses were surveyed, but only Chill Penguin, Mammoth, and Armadillo were
played through during this pass. Treat other boss interactions as needing more
playtesting.

Planned work includes Zero armor parts: legs for double jump and air dash,
arms for a purple saber and more damage, with the other parts still to be
defined. Additional Zero saber techniques and Zero-related dialogue and other
cutscene entries are also planned.

## Running the tests

These are RaphaelAzev's MinGW commands from the fork. The ROM-backed runner
also needs private save fixtures under `_private/saves`. The commands below do
not reconfigure CMake:

```bash
export PATH="/c/msys64/mingw64/bin:$PATH"
cd MegaManXSNESRecompSaberZero
cmake --build build-mingw
ctest --test-dir build-mingw --output-on-failure
bash tools/saber/run_saber_rom_tests.sh
```

The Saber runner's no-argument form runs its default pass and every named group
in isolated test runs, and returns zero only when all of them pass. It includes
the input, attack lifecycle, buster, finisher, priority, damage, renderer,
Ride Armor, package, upstream Zero parity, response-seam, and fixture checks.
To run one named group, for example:

```bash
MMX_SABER_TEST_ONLY=saber-priority bash tools/saber/run_saber_rom_tests.sh
```

`zero-response-seam` is exercised once through the interpreted path and once
through the compiled path by the runner. The ROM-backed runner needs the local
Mega Man X USA and Mega Man X3 USA ROM selections and the documented test save
inputs; it does not print ROM or save bytes.

CTest covers the unit, renderer, asset, and generated-hook checks. If the
`mmx_reset_reboots` test is the only intermittent failure, rerun the same CTest
command once; a repeated failure is not considered a pass.
